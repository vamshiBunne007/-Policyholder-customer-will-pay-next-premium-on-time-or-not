Your client is an Insurance company and they need your help in building a model to predict whether the policyholder (customer) will pay next premium on time or not. An insurance policy is an arrangement by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for specified loss, damage, illness, or death in return for the payment of a specified premium. A premium is a sum of money that you pay regularly to an insurance company for this guarantee.
